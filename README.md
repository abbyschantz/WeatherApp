# WeatherApp

This app uses [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) api to retrieve weather data. 

The user is able to add new cities to a list of cities that are saved. The user is also able to remove cities from that list. Upon clicking on a city in the list, the user will be taken to a new activity with two fragments, main and details. The main fragment displays the city name, date ect while the details fragment includes information such as max and min temp, humidity, and sunrise.
